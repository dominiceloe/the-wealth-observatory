# Citation URL Improvements

## Problem Identified

Source URLs were pointing to organization homepages (e.g., `https://solar-aid.org/`) instead of specific pages documenting the costs, making verification difficult for users.

## Solution Implemented

All citation URLs have been updated to point to **specific documentation pages** where the costs and methodology can be verified.
